You're correct, I apologize for the confusion. 

Let's go step-by-step to create the "Hello, World!" application with C# by using the console app (.NET Core):

1. First, install the .NET Core SDK from the .NET download page.
2. Create an empty project. Here's how do you make the empty project in C#:
```csharp
dotnet new console -o helloWorldApp
```
3. After running the above command in your terminal, a new directory named helloWorldApp is created and inside of that a new console application was created.
4. Navigate to that new created folder with the following command:
```csharp
cd helloWorldApp
```
5. Inside the helloWorldApp directory, you will find a Program.cs file. In this you will write the actual code. Automatically generated code:
```csharp
using System;

namespace helloWorldApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```
6. Then run this command to execute the application:
```csharp
dotnet run
```
You will see that the console shows "Hello World!". 

If you want to create a new test project for this main project, you can use below commands:
1. Create new mstest project:
```csharp
dotnet new mstest -o HelloWorld.Tests
```
2. Navigate to the new test project:
```csharp
cd HelloWorld.Tests
```
3. Add a reference to the main project:
```csharp
dotnet add reference ../helloWorldApp/helloWorldApp.csproj
```
4. Inside the unit test project, create a new test:
```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace HelloWorld.Tests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class HelloWorldTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void HelloWorld_PrintsCorrectly()
        {
            var writer = new StringWriter();
            Console.SetOut(writer);

            helloWorldApp.Program.Main(null);

            var output = writer.GetStringBuilder().ToString().Trim();
            Assert.AreEqual("Hello, World!", output);
        }
    }
}
```
In the above test class we are testing that the Main function in the HelloWorld program prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

To run the tests:
```csharp
dotnet test
```
